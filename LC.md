# Liberal Committership (Draft v0.1)

The goal of Liberal Committership is to distribute and grow access controls as widely as possible.

* Any non-trival contribution, once accepted, should result in write access to the project
* All contributions, including those by project owners, must be accepted by another contributor.
* Contributors should not accept contributions that are under active discussion.
