# Formalizing the CONTRIBUTING file.

Many developers in the open source community are working towards more ethical forms of governance, conduct, and culture. To date most of this work has been in blogs, conference talks, and in conversation.

> CONTRIBUTING is the new LICENSE

The previous generation of open source iterated and eventually codified their values in to the myriad of public licenses we use today. This formal form allowed them to collaborate and iterate on their ideas, which then developers all over the world showed their support of by using and posting those licenses in their projects.

The CONTRIBUTING file has, to date, been a place to dump instructions for the use of source control or mailing lists. We would like to begin to formalize different ideas about open governance, codes of conduct, and ethics in to versioned documents people can adopt by adding them to their CONTRIBUTING file.

Once established communities than then expect and request these in the projects they engage with, in the same way that many open source contributors require that an acceptable public license is used.
